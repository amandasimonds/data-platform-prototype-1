## UV UI Prototype

UV UI Prototype project is a bridge between UI Design and Frontend Engineering. This resource can be used as a reference to the latest UI updates, as well as a preview for PO's and customers. The static website is served here: https://uvuiprototype.z13.web.core.windows.net.

The Prototype app lives on the [prototype/demo](https://dev.azure.com/pdd-ihsmarkit/EPD/_git/uv-platform-design?version=GBprototype%2Fdemo) branch and contains the pages of the app. 
You will see in the html templates, we are using components and SCSS styles from **uv-ui-lib library**.
**uv-ui-lib library** is found here: [/uv-ui-lib/projects/uv-ui-lib](https://dev.azure.com/pdd-ihsmarkit/EPD/_git/uv-platform-design?version=GBprototype%2Fdemo&path=%2Fuv-ui-lib%2Fprojects%2Fuv-ui-prototype).
