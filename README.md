### UV UI Design Prototype

#### Introduction

This project serves as a sandbox environment for the Design Team, primarily for experiencing UI/UX designs through software instead of static mockups. It acts as another layer of mockups that the design team can use and build upon, and as an important tool for Usability Testing with our customers.

Please note that implemented designs will sometimes correspond to existing designs for Beta, but will also correspond to post-beta designs that are still under review and testing. Therefore, Engineering teams should continue to reference approved InVision links for front end development.


#### Usability Testing

Usability testing is done internally, by people within the team, and externally, by customers.
